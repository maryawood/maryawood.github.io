excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am Bioinformatics Research Analyst working with Hi-C sequencing data at Phase Genomics. I earned my Master’s degree in Biology from University of Oregon’s (UO) Applied Bioinformatics and Genomic Master’s Program (2017).

I first became excited about research working as a biology undergraduate with Drs. Bradshaw and Holzapfel at UO’s Institute of Ecology and Evolution. I worked both independently and with graduate students on research projects studying the evolution of biting in the pitcher plant mosquito, with interest in its implications for fighting the transmission of vector-borne diseases. After graduating with honors from UO, I began pursuing a Master’s degree in the Bradshaw-Holzapfel lab to continue this research.

During my graduate coursework, I became excited about learning bioinformatics skills to answer research questions that help fight disease, and transitioned to the Bioinformatics and Genomics Master’s program at UO. After completing my degree, I worked with Dr. Reid Thompson and the Portland Genomics (PDXgx) research group to better understand patient response to immunotherapy at the genomic level and develop software to help achieve these goals. Since transitioning to work at Phase Genomics, I'm using my bioinformatics skills to analyze Hi-C sequencing data and better understand the physical structure of DNA in a variety of organisms.
