excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a Research Associate studying the genomics of immunotherapy through the Portland VA Research Foundation and the Computational Biology Program at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU). I earned my Master’s degree in Biology from University of Oregon’s (UO) Applied Bioinformatics and Genomic Master’s Program (2017).

I first became excited about research working as a biology undergraduate with Drs. Bradshaw and Holzapfel at UO’s Institute of Ecology and Evolution. I worked both independently and with graduate students on research projects studying the evolution of biting in the pitcher plant mosquito, with interest in its implications for fighting the transmission of vector-borne diseases. After graduating with honors from UO, I began pursuing a Master’s degree in the Bradshaw-Holzapfel lab to continue this research.

During my graduate coursework, I became excited about learning bioinformatics skills to answer research questions that help fight disease, and transitioned to the Bioinformatics and Genomics Master’s program at UO. I now work with Dr. Reid Thompson and the Portland Genomics (PDXgx) research group, as well as collaborators at OHSU, in Portland, and across the country, to better understand patient response to immunotherapy at the genomic level and develop software to help achieve these goals.
