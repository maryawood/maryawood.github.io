excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a Data Scientist at [Phase Genomics](https://phasegenomics.com/) working to develop a diagnostic tool for chromosomal abnormalities from Hi-C sequencing data. I earned my Master’s degree in Biology from University of Oregon’s (UO) Applied Bioinformatics and Genomic Master’s Program (2017).

I first became excited about health research working as a biology undergraduate with Drs. Bradshaw and Holzapfel at UO’s Institute of Ecology and Evolution. I worked both independently and with graduate students on research projects studying the evolution of biting in the pitcher plant mosquito, with interest in its implications for fighting the transmission of vector-borne diseases. After graduating with honors from UO in 2014, I began pursuing a Master’s degree in the Bradshaw-Holzapfel lab to continue this research.

During my graduate coursework, I became excited about learning bioinformatics skills to answer research questions that help fight disease, and transitioned to the Bioinformatics and Genomics Master’s program at UO in 2016. After completing my degree, I worked with Dr. Reid Thompson and the Portland Genomics (PDXgx) research group to better understand patient response to immunotherapy at the genomic level and develop software to help achieve these goals. 

Since starting at Phase Genomics in December 2020, I've used my bioinformatics skills to assist customers with research projects by analyzing Hi-C sequencing data from a variety of organisms as a Bioinformatics Research Analyst. In June 2021, I transitioned to a role as a Data Scientist, focusing on developing deep learning approaches to identifying structural variants that may cause infertility and disease.
