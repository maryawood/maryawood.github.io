## Experience

`January 2018 - present`

__Research Associate__

Portland VA Research Foundation/Computational Biology Program at Oregon Health and Science University 

- Analyze publicly available sequencing data from cancer patients to identify genomic predictors of response to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment
-	Collaboratively develop and benchmark open-source, extensively unit-tested, pip installable python software for neoepitope prediction
-	Train machine learning models to characterize proteasomal cleavage sites based on protein sequence context
-	Fluently use state of the art genomics software, personalized python scripts, R-based statistical analysis, bash scripting, and job scheduling for parallel computing


`January 2017 - December 2017`

__Computational Biology Internship__ 

Computational Biology Program at Oregon Health and Science University

- Developed a neoepitope prediction method that improves upon existing methods by incorporating phasing of variants in shared haplotypes
-	Identified population-level distributions of neoepitopes in genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and evaluated criteria for improved prioritization of predicted neoepitopes
-	Used and adapted of a variety of bioinformatics software for sequence alignment, variant calling, HLA type prediction, neoepitope prediction, and more


`January 2017 - December 2017`

__CRISPR Data Analysis Project__

Bioinformatics and Genomics Master's Program at Oregon Health and Science University

- Evaluated the success of CRISPR/Cas9 treatment as a potential therapy to correct the sickle cell anemia SNP
-	Determined the precision of editing and zygosity of edits in clones of CRISPR-treated cells using GATK HaplotypeCaller to identify mutations


`January 2015 - December 2016`

__Graduate Teaching Fellow__

Department of Biology at University of Oregon 

- Led two weekly laboratory sections of 16-32 students each for undergraduate biology courses
- Met with students in office hours and by appointment to provide guidance on assignments and stimulate understanding of course material
-	Evaluated and provided constructive feedback on student papers, presentations, tests, and lab reports


`January 2015 - March 2015`

__Advanced Molecular Biology Research Lab Course__

Department of Biology at University of Oregon 

- Identified a transposon-induced mutation in a gene that conferred a photosynthetic mutant phenotype in maize
-	Used Integrated Genome Viewer to identify a Mu transposon insertion site in Mu-Illumina sequence data
-	Confirmed Mu transposon insertion site using PCR analysis


`January 2014 - May 2014`

__Honors Research Project__

Bradshaw-Holzapfel Laboratory, Institute of Ecology and Evolution at University of Oregon 

- Conducted independent undergraduate research on the role of larval nutrition on adult biting propensity in the pitcher plant mosquito by raising populations of varying larval nutrition and measuring the frequency of biting among adult females
-	Wrote and publicly defended an honors thesis


`January 2012 - December 2014`

__Undergraduate Research Assistant__

Bradshaw-Holzapfel Laboratory, Institute of Ecology and Evolution at University of Oregon

-	Consulted with Principal Investigators and graduate students to maintain essential operations of the laboratory
-	Mentored new employees on laboratory regulations and organized sessions to work on collaborative projects
-	Presented at several laboratory meetings each year on scientific topics of interest, such as vector-borne diseases
